Added README Files

This is a README file that I am editing on my own local account

  The text directly above was written while synced with the MacLab Linux Computers 

  Lab Assignment:
    -The way I created my repo was first, I signed up for an account with GitHub as I previously did not have one. Once in the main screen of the dashboard, I navigated over to the top left-hand corner of the screen and selected "New Repo". After this was done, I created the "README" and "hello_class.py) files respectively
    -First, I had to configure the Linux Terminal in such a way that it allowed to me to access my GitHub repository directly. To do this, I had to identify both my Git username and my repository to the linux system using the "git config --global" commands. After this, I was to create an ssh key to connect the Linux Terminal directly to my Repo. I copied and pasted the key that Linux spitted out inot the SSH portion of my Repo's settings. This step originally created a syntax error but I quickly corrected it. 
    -To Clone the repo, first I needed to navigate to the home directory
