Added README Files

This is a README file that I am editing on my own local account

  The text directly above was written while synced with the MacLab Linux Computers 

  Lab Assignment:
    -The way I created my repo was first, I signed up for an account with GitHub as I previously did not have one. Once in the main screen of the dashboard, I navigated over to the top left-hand corner of the screen and selected "New Repo". After this was done, I created the "README" and "hello_class.py) files respectively
    
    -First, I had to configure the Linux Terminal in such a way that it allowed to me to access my GitHub repository directly. To do this, I had to identify both my Git username and my repository to the linux system using the "git config --global" commands. After this, I was to create an ssh key to connect the Linux Terminal directly to my Repo. I copied and pasted the key that Linux spitted out inot the SSH portion of my Repo's settings. This step originally created a syntax error but I quickly corrected it. 
    
    -To Clone the repo, first I needed to navigate to the home directory to the clone it using the "git clone git@github.com:[username]/[lab name].git" command. Next, to edit the repo directly through Linux, I used pico README.md . Once done with the editing, I instructed Linux to track such changes and then commited them with the respective functions. Finally, I used the "git push" functions to allow my changes to sync with my GitHub account 

    -There are several ways to correct mistaked, using the cd command allows you to move up just one directory. You could also try cloning the repo once more to create a new copy from scrath. If all else fails and there is no other option, you can eliminate the local repo by using the rm-rf function. Once used, you will be back to square one 

    -Throughout this entire process it is crucial to consider the syntax of your commands as it can cause issues for you later on if you do not pay attention to it.
